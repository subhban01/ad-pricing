# Ad Pricing

This is a front-end implementation of an ad-pricing-checkout system.  
It's built using React.js and Typescript.  
The app is using react-router for routing and zustand for state management.

## Problem statement

Build a job ads checkout system that offers standard pricing on various products and also provisions special pricing for a few priviledged customers. Special pricing is regularly renegotiated, so the ask is to keep the pricing rules as flexible as possible as they can change in the future with little notice.

## Setting it up

```
git clone git@github.com:subhban01/ad-pricing.git
cd ad-pricing
yarn install
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Running tests

`yarn test` will run all the tests.
